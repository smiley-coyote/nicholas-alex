     <p>As a native of a small coastal town in Florida, 
       I knew from an early age I had a knack for creativity 
       that would carry into adulthood. After earning a degree 
       in Film with a minor in Digital Media from the University 
       of Central Florida, I held various jobs unrelated to film 
       that failed to fulfill my creativity. This boredom led me 
       to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at home. I quickly 
       decided to switch my focus to Web Development after realizing 
       how much I enjoyed building websites.
     <br>
     <br>
          My name is Nick and I currently live in the Orlando area. 
          I am a recent graduate from a Web Development coding bootcamp 
          at UCF, and I am currently pursuing a career in Web Development. 
          I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, and React 
          (full list of skills below). I am eager to continue to learn and 
          grow in this industry.

            My Critic Review is a website for people who want to find movie critics that they can trust.
            Rate and review movies, follow your top matched critics, and get a percentage of approval for all movies
            based on your top matches.
            <!-- As a person who loves to go out to the movies but doesn't want to waste the money
            or time on something not completely satisfactory, I heavily rely on critic reviews.
            Not all critic reviews are trustworthy however, and it is sometimes difficult to find a
            somebody with the same movie interests as yourself. Imagine a website that matched you
            up with critics based on your previous rating history? This is the idea I had when building
            My Critic Review. I created an alogorithm that matches a user up with other users who have
            rated movies similarly. Follow your top matched critics, get a percentage of approval for all movies
            based on your top matches, and rate/review movies yourself for others to read. It's like Facebook
            for movie critics. Primary languages used were JavaScript, Node, React, and MongoDB. -->
